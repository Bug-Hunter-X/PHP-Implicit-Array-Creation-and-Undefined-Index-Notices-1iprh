In PHP, a common yet easily overlooked error arises when dealing with array keys that are not explicitly defined.  Consider this scenario:  `$myArray['key'] = 'value';` If `$myArray` is not already an array, accessing `$myArray['key']` will trigger a notice, not an error, in many cases.  The notice only warns about the implicit array creation.  This can lead to unexpected behavior, especially in larger applications where such notices are easily missed or masked.  For instance, you may intend to update existing array entries, but end up adding new ones. To resolve this issue, you should use `isset()` or `array_key_exists()` to check if a key exists before assigning a value to it, or initialize the array first, e.g., `$myArray = [];` before using it.
